# Stable Diffusion text to image models with Azure AI Foundry
Microsoft is excited to collaborate with Stability AI, one of the leaders in AI-powered visual generation to bring Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable Image Ultra, and Stable Image Core to the model catalog in Azure AI Foundry.

## Stable Image Large
At 8.1 billion parameters, Stable Diffusion 3.5 is the most powerful model in the Stable Diffusion family. Our collaboration with Stability AI brings this sophisticated model to our catalog, introducing image-to-image capabilities to Azure AI Foundry for the first time. The model delivers exceptional text-to-image generation with superior quality and prompt adherence, making it ideal for professional use cases at 1 megapixel resolution.â€¯

## Stable Image Ultra
Powered by the advanced capabilities of Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable Image Ultra sets a new standard in photorealism. Stable Image Ultra is ideal for product imagery in marketing and advertising. It also excels in typography, dynamic lighting, and vibrant color rendering.

## Stable Image Core
Leveraging an enhanced version of SDXL, Stable Image Core, delivers exceptional speed and efficiency while maintaining the high-quality output synonymous with Stable Diffusion models.
